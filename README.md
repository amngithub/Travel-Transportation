# Travel-Transportation
The travel &amp; transportation industries have never lacked data, as itâ€™s collected across every interaction point. Whether for a guest, passenger or cargo, data helps to balance demand with supply to optimize revenue and profitability of its inventory and capacity. From travel and hospitality across airlines, hotels, car rental and cruise companies, each are capturing customer behaviors and experiences that contain valuable insights for the business. But travel and transportation analytics methods tend to be slow and aren't always intuitive. At the same time, transportation and logistics companies across trucking, freight rail, air delivery, maritime, and logistics service providers are trying to link disparate data sources to manage network and capacity planning as well as optimize routes for profitability.
